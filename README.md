# ANN
Artifical Neural Network for AI 2017 class at Kennesaw State University

Neural network basic design that was created for an AI class. I have too many hidden layers in this application so the Network does not properly function. The basics are there including passing data through the nodes, the code just needs a little cleaning up to make it look nice and more readable. I would also love to create a basic GUI for it, but I am not sure how much time I will reinvest in this project.
